### Recommended operating environment
1. Ubuntu 14.04; 
2. ROS Indigo; 
3. Gazebo 5.0 or 5.1
4. gazebo_ros_pkgs
NOTE:
If you choose "desktop-full" install of ROS Indigo, there is a Gazebo 2.0 included initially. In order to install Gazebo 5.0/5.1, you should first remove Gazebo 2.0 by running:
    $ sudo apt-get remove gazebo2*
Then you should be able to install Gazebo 5.0 now.
To install gazebo_ros_pkgs compatible with Gazebo 5.0/5.1, run this command:
    $ sudo apt-get install ros-indigo-gazebo5-ros-pkgs ros-indigo-gazebo5-ros-control
    
Other versions of Ubuntu, ROS or Gazebo may also work, but we have not tested yet.

### Complie
1. Go to the root directory (single_nubot_gazebo_ws)
2. If you already have CMakeLists.txt in the "src" folder, then you can skip this step. 
   If not, run these commands:
    $ cd src 
    $ catkin_init_workspace
    $ cd ..
3. $ ./configure
4. $ catkin_make --pkg nubot_common
5. $ catkin_make

### Run
1. Go to the root directory (single_nubot_gazebo_ws)
2. source the setup.bash file: 
    $ source devel/setup.bash
Note: Every time you open a new terminal, you have to do this step. You can also write this command into the ~/.bashrc file so that you don't have to source it every time.
3.  $ roslaunch nubot_gazebo sdf_nubot.launch
Additional:
    a. to launch an empty soccer field: $ roslaunch nubot_gazebo empty_field.launch
    b. to launch the simulation world with rqt_plot of nubot or ball's velocity:
        $ roslaunch nubot_gazebo sdf_nubot.launch plot:=true
